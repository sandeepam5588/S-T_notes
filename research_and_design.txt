===================================================================


My manager has given me some use cases on Health insurance claim processing. 
we have to design database(Relational), rest webservices, microservices using Java and spring boot.

use case talks about Health insurance claims. 

there are two actors in the system
	1. Payers are organizations that process and pay claims for healthcare services, and determine coverage amounts. 
	   Payers can be private  surance companies, Medicare, or Medicaid.
	   We have to designe the solution by Payer centric or payer point of view. We no need to maintain any Payer details in the database, beacuse we are the Payer.

	2. Providers are individuals or organizations that offer healthcare services to patients, such as hospitals or clinics.
	   we have to maintain the providers details in our database. Only registered providers can user our system for claims processing.

as per the given usecases i think we have to develop three microservices
	1. Fraud Detection System
	2. Claims Processing System
	3. Payment System

here is the functionalities of each microservice
	1. Fraud Detection System : Analyzing claims for potential fraud algorithms and rules based systems
	   - Fraud detection algrotihms to analyse the claim
	   - Flags suspicious claims for further investigation

	   Preconditios
		- claims are undergoing adjudication

	   API's
	   - analyze cliam for fraud : to analyze whether the given claim is fraud or not and Flag suspicious claims for further investigation
	   - Fraud Alert Dashboard : to display all the claims that are detected as fraud

	   page: Fraud Aleart Dashboard

		 	Field Name		Description
		 	Claim ID		unique identifier for the claim
		 	Member ID 		unique identifier for the provider
		 	Alert Level		level of fraud alert(High, Medium, Low)
		 	Alert reason	Reason for the alert
		 	Action Taken	Actions taken based on the alert

	2. Claims Prpcessing System : Applying fee schedules and contracts to determine payment amounts and calculating member and payer responsibilities.
		- Calculates payment
		- allows Payer to Oversee payment calculation
		- Finalizes the claim decision
		- Explanation of Benefits(EOB) is generated and sent to the provider and member

		Preconditions
		- claims have passed fraud detection checks

		API's
		- calculate the payment: system applies fee schedules and contracts to determine payment amounts. calculates member's cost sharing and payer's responsibility
		- display payment details : the payer can see the payment details of a claim
		- finalize the claim : the payer can finalize the claim decision
		- EOB : to generate EOB and send to the provider

		- page : Payment calculation view

			Filed Name				 Description
			Claim ID 				: Unique identifier for the claim
			service codes			: codes representing services(CAT/HCPCS)
			Fee schedule    		: Fee schedule applied
			Provider contract 		: contract details with provider
			Member cost sharing		: Member responsibility(co-pay, Deductible, co-insurance)
			Payer Responsibility 	: Amount the payer is responsible for
			Total Payment 			: Total payment amount

		Pre conditions
		- Payment calculations are complete

		- page: Claims decision page

		FieldName		Description
		Claim ID 		Unique identifier for the claim
		Final Decision 	Final decision(Approved, Denied)
		EOB Details		Explanation of Benefits details
		Denial Reasons	Reasons for detail if applicable


	3.Payment system : Processing payments for approved claims and disbursing funds to providers
		- Processes payments
		- allowes Payer to Oversee the payment process

	Pre conditions
		- Claims have been approved for payment

	API's
	- Approved claims proceed to payment processing
	- Payments are disbursed to providers via the chosen method

	-page: payment disbursement view

		FieldName		Description
		Claim ID  		unique identifier for the claim
		Payment method	method of payment(EFT, Checks)
		Payment date	date of payment
		payemnt amount 	Amount to be paid
		Provier account details		Provider's account details for payment

Note : We have to design and develop the system as Payer point of view.
